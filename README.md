# House-Price-Estimation

Most existing automatic house price estimation systems rely only on some textual data like its neighborhood area and the number of rooms. In this project, we practice with algorithms to extract visual features from house photos and combining them with the house’s textual information.
The goal of this project is to build a novel house price estimation system by using both textual and visual inputs, other than only using textual information such as area, neighborhood, and number of bedrooms.
